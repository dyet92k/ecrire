  # Ecrire::Application is the entry point when running
  # a blog.
  # 
  # The big difference between this application and a normal Rails
  # application is that Ecrire will look for +secrets.yml+ in the
  # current working directory.
  #
  # If it doesn't find one, it will load the Onboarding process
  # so the user can configure the database and the first user.
  #
  # If the application finds +secrets.yml+, it will load the Theme which is located
  # in the current working directory.
  #

    ##
    # There seems to be a crack between when the configuration
    # is loaded and when the initializer collection is built.
    #
    # Ecrire requires the configuration to be loaded before
    # knowing which module it should load based on the current
    # configuration.
    #
    # Another issue happens with railties being memoized before
    # Ecrire could figure out if the user needs to be onboarded.
    #
    # For those reasons, this method is overloaded.
